# suffrage restoration bills

This repo contains a `csv` file of every bill introduced in the MS Legislature (since 1997) to restore someone's right to vote after they lost that right due to permanent felony disenfranchisement. A public-facing table of the data is available at https://bfeldman89.com/projects/suffrage-bills/. I am hosting the data here in hopes of open-sourcing the process of extracting additional data from the bills (e.g., the county of conviction(s), year of conviction(s), offese(s), etc.).
